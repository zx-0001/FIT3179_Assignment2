            With advances in science and technology, we are currently living in
            the most prosperous era in human history and this is especially true
            for those living in high-income countries. However, it is worth
            looking back and seeing exactly how much we have progressed as a
            whole on a global scale, to see how much progress has been achieved
            in different regions.

            The following visualisations used data from the World Bank of
            different countries' socio-economic variables and life expectancy
            from 2000-2019.

            Intuitively speaking, more spending on health should increase life
            expectancy but from the graph, there does not appear to be any
            universal correlation between health expenditure (% GDP) and life
            expectancy. The legend can be clicked to highlight the region of
            interest.

        <div class="column_right">
          <p>
            Interestingly, some countries like Singapore, have high life
            expectancy despite having a lower % of health expenditure whereas a
            country like Afghanistan has a comparatively low life expectancy.
            This can either mean there are other more important unobserved
            variables that affect life expectancy or % of health expenditure is
            not a good variable to correlate with life expectancy.
